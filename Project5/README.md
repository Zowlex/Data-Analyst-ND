# Fatal Police Shootings in the US
## by Fares Lassoued


## Dataset

The dataset consists of information regarding 2545 fatal police shootings that place in the United states between Jan 01 2015 and Jan 01 2018.

The dataset was gathered from kaggle and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us) 

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found out that the age of the people is right skewed meaning that older people are getting killed more and the gender ratio of victims is 90% men and 10% women and only 25% of killed people have shown signs of mental illness. I also found out that black people are getting killed the most, respectively to the black race proportion. The number of monthly was around 60 to 80, however starting from Feb 2017 to May 2017 this number kept suddenly falling to below 20 kills per month and this may be related to the start of Trump's presidency. Added to that, the states showing high number of killings are California (CA), Texas (TX) and Florida (FL) while the states with lowest number of killings are relatively smaller like Rhode Island (RI), Vermont (VT), however when comparing CA's and RI's poverty rate, percentage of people over 25 that completed high school, median house income and race proportions, CA had wider variety of races while RI's were more white people and it also had higher poverty rate, lower median income and lower school completion percentage, and all this without taking into account the diffrence in population where CA's population is 39 times more than Rhode Islands'.

The relationship between age and different variables depicts that killed black people are on average more younger than white people while the signs of mental illness are showing among wide range of ages and especially old people (above 50). Also, the relationship between weapon usage and state shwoed that gun was the most used weapon in all states and with high numbers in California and Texas. 




## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I want to focus on killings per race and how it is related to recent #BlackLiveMatter events, I also want to emphasize the difference between the states in terms of poverty, high school completion and median house income and gun usage which shakes the problem of gun laws in the US.
