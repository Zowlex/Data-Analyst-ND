# Data Analyst Nanodegree projects (status: ongoing)

## Project1: Explore weather trends

In this project, we're asked to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live (Tunis, Tunisia) to overall global temperature trends.


Gained skills:
  - Working on csv files using **Pandas/Numpy**
  - Data Visualization using **Matplotlib**

## Project2: Soccer Database Analysis 

For this project, I decided to use the [soccer database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) for European teams provided on **Kaggle** which contains data for soccer matches, players, and
teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. I want to explore
and discover the important factors for Elite players and most winning teams,
as well as players and team progressions over the years.

Gained skills:
  - Handling different dataset format (**sqlite** database converted to csv)
  - Working on csv files using **Pandas/Numpy**
  - Data Visualization using **Matplotlib/seaborn**

## Project3: Analyze A/B test results

Perform A/B test and analyze results to help a company decide between a new developed page and an old one for their e-commerce website. 

Gained skills:
  - Practical statistics including:
    - Probability/Conditional Probability/Bayes Rule/Normal distribution theory/Sampling distributions and central limit theorem
    - Confidence Intervals/ Hypothesis Testing
  - Regression:
    - Linear/Logistic Regression
  - Difference between Hypothesis testing and Regression models
