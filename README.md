## Project2: Soccer Database Analysis 

For this project, I decided to use the [soccer database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) for European teams provided on **Kaggle** which contains data for soccer matches, players, and
teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. I want to explore
and discover the important factors for Elite players and most winning teams,
as well as players and team progressions over the years.
